# Bezier Terrain

This 3D terrain was built using a combination of Bezier patches and Perlin Noise Function. The Bezier patches are animated using sine functions and the Perlin Noise is interpolated on them. The different parameters of the noise function can be manipulated in real-time by tweaking them from the Unity user interface.
